Hello, you can call me icepuddle. Scripting (and programming in general) has been a passion of mine for many years, and I am an aspiring game developer. I'm 15, if you were wondering. I have an affinity for projects involving data stores, but I am always striving to gain a wider variety of skills.
I've been scripting on roblox for 2 years now and been a fan of Roblox for the past 5 years; experienced within the community
